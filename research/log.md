# Research Log 📚

## 2026-01-30

### Session Start
Research capability initialized. Ready to scout sources and experiment.

### Initial Scout - arXiv cs.AI (275 new papers today!)

**🔥 High Relevance for loa:**

1. **Agent-RRM: Exploring Reasoning Reward Model for Agents** ([arXiv:2601.22154](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22154))
   - Multi-faceted reward model for agentic trajectories
   - Produces: reasoning trace, critique with refinement guidance, process score
   - Three integration strategies: Reagent-C/R/U
   - 43.7% on GAIA benchmark
   - **Potential loa upgrade:** Could add structured feedback to agent evaluation, improve the Auditor's critique quality
   - Code: https://github.com/kxfan2002/Reagent

2. **World of Workflows** ([arXiv:2601.22130](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22130))
   - Enterprise benchmark with 4000+ business rules, 55 workflows
   - Key insight: "dynamics blindness" - LLMs fail to predict cascading side effects
   - Agents need "grounded world modeling" to simulate hidden state transitions
   - **Potential loa upgrade:** Explicit state modeling in Sprint execution, side-effect prediction

3. **Liquid Interfaces** ([arXiv:2601.21993](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21993))
   - Ephemeral relational events instead of static interfaces
   - Intention-driven interaction, semantic negotiation
   - **Potential loa upgrade:** Could improve agent-to-agent handoff patterns

### Ideas for Experiments

- [ ] `experiment/reasoning-reward-model` - Adapt Agent-RRM for loa's critique system
- [ ] `experiment/world-modeling` - Add state prediction to Sprint agent
- [ ] `experiment/liquid-handoffs` - Dynamic agent coordination

## Agentic Design Patterns (Antonio Gulli)

**Source:** https://github.com/sarwarbeing-ai/Agentic_Design_Patterns

21 patterns with code examples (Google ADK, LangChain, CrewAI):

1. Prompt Chaining
2. Routing
3. Parallelization
4. **Reflection** ← Auditor upgrade
5. Tool Use
6. Planning
7. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** ← Agent orchestration
8. Memory Management
9. Adaptation
10. MCP (Model Context Protocol)
11. Goal Setting & Monitoring
12. Exception Handling
13. Human-in-the-Loop
14. Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)
15. **Inter-Agent Communication (A2A)** ← Agent handoffs
16. Resource-Aware Optimization
17. **Reasoning Techniques** ← CoT, self-correction
18. **Guardrails/Safety** ← Security Agent
19. **Evaluation (LLM as Judge)** ← Auditor scoring
20. Prioritization
21. Exploration & Discovery

**Priority experiments:**
- [ ] `experiment/llm-judge-auditor` - Structured rubrics for Auditor
- [ ] `experiment/reflection-loops` - Iterative self-correction in Sprint
- [ ] `experiment/a2a-handoffs` - AgentCard protocol for agent communication

## Clawdbot Architecture Deep Dive (Hesam @Hesamation)

**Source**: Twitter thread, 2026-01-30

### Key Architecture Components

1. **Gateway Server** - Lane-based command queue
   - Serial by default, explicit parallel
   - "What's safe to parallelize?" > "What do I need to lock?"

2. **Agent Runner** - Dynamic prompt assembly
   - Tools + skills + memory + history → context window guard → LLM call

3. **Agentic Loop** - Tool calls until final text or ~20 turns

4. **Memory System**
   - Session: JSONL transcripts
   - Long-term: Markdown files (MEMORY.md, memory/)
   - Search: Hybrid vector (SQLite) + keyword (FTS5)
   - No forgetting curve — old memories equal weight
   - No special API — agent uses `write` tool

5. **Browser** - Semantic snapshots (ARIA tree)
   - 5MB screenshot → <50KB text
   - 100x token efficiency
   - Browsing is structural, not visual

### Improvement Opportunities

- [ ] Memory decay / relevance scoring
- [ ] Tool result clearing (from loa Auditor)
- [ ] Smarter compaction (semantic chunking)
- [ ] Lane priority for time-sensitive ops
