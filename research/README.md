# Research Lab 🔬

Legba's space for exploring cutting-edge agentic engineering and experimenting with loa upgrades.

## Sources

- **arXiv** - AI/ML papers (cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.MA)
- **Hacker News** - Tech discussions, emerging patterns
- **GitHub Trending** - Agentic repos, new frameworks
- **Papers With Code** - Implementations worth studying

## Process

1. **Scout** - Scan sources for relevant developments
2. **Evaluate** - Does this apply to loa? What would it improve?
3. **Branch** - Create `experiment/` branch from staging
4. **Implement** - Build the experimental upgrade
5. **Document** - Log findings in `research/experiments/`

## Experiment Branches

Naming: `experiment/<topic>-<date>`
Example: `experiment/chain-of-draft-2026-01-30`

## Tracking

- `research/log.md` - What I've found, what I'm exploring
- `research/experiments/` - Detailed experiment writeups
- `research/sources.json` - Last checked timestamps
