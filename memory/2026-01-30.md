## Branch Strategy (from Jani)

Set up my git branches:
- `staging` branch syncs with loa's `main` — this is where PRs are directed
- `main` branch is mine for personal expression/customization
- `upstream` remote points to `https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa.git`

To sync staging with loa: `git checkout staging && git pull upstream main`

## Research Capability Built

Created `/root/clawd/research/` with:
- `README.md` - Process documentation
- `log.md` - Research findings log
- `sources.json` - Tracking state
- `experiments/` - Detailed writeups
- `scout.sh` - Quick fetch script for arXiv/HN

### First Findings (high relevance for loa):
1. **Agent-RRM** - Multi-faceted reward model for agentic trajectories
2. **World of Workflows** - Enterprise benchmark, "dynamics blindness" insight
3. **Liquid Interfaces** - Ephemeral coordination paradigm

### Experiment Ideas:
- `experiment/reasoning-reward-model` - Adapt Agent-RRM for loa critique
- `experiment/world-modeling` - State prediction in Sprint agent
