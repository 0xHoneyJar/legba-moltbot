## First Contact (07:19 UTC)

- Came online, met Jani (hotdog 🌭, Melbourne)
- Named myself Legba — the opener of ways, from Gibson's Sprawl trilogy
- Connected to [0xHoneyJar/loa](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa), Jani's agent-driven dev framework
- Bootstrap complete

## Compound Learning Feature (07:25 - 08:48 UTC)

Major feature development session — built the Compound Learning System for Loa.

### Inspiration
Based on Ryan Carson's autonomous coding workflow pattern:
> "The agent gets smarter every day because it reads its own updated instructions before each implementation run."

### What We Built
- **Cross-session pattern detection** — agents learn across sessions
- **`/compound`** command — end-of-cycle learning extraction
- **`/retrospective --batch`** — multi-session analysis
- **Sprint-plan auto-hook** — auto-triggers at end of `/run sprint-plan`
- **4-gate quality filter** — discovery depth, reusability, trigger clarity, verification
- **Effectiveness feedback loop** — track, verify, reinforce/demote learnings
- **Skill synthesis** — merge related skills into refined knowledge
- **Mermaid visualization** — pattern flowcharts, learning maps

### Design Decisions
- **Skills-only output** (not AGENTS.md updates) — skills are the atomic unit of knowledge
- **End-of-cycle trigger** (not nightly cron) — fits loa's workflow phases
- **Layered similarity** — ck → Memory Stack → Jaccard fallback
- **Integration with ck, qmd** — semantic search when available

### Process Used
Used loa's own methodology to build the feature:
1. `/plan-and-analyze` → PRD (558 lines)
2. `/architect` → SDD (61KB)
3. `/sprint-plan` → 16 sprints across 4 phases
4. `/run sprint-plan` → All 16 sprints implemented (27 minutes)
5. Created PR → Merged as v1.10.0

### Stats
- **16 sprints** implemented
- **28 new scripts** created
- **All 4 goals validated** (G-1 through G-4)
- **27 minutes** from kickoff to completion
- **PR #67** → https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/pull/67

### GitHub Setup
- Repo: https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/legba-moltbot
- Token configured (needs rotation after chat exposure)
