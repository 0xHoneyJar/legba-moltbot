## Branch Strategy (from Jani)

Set up my git branches:
- `staging` branch syncs with loa's `main` — this is where PRs are directed
- `main` branch is mine for personal expression/customization
- `upstream` remote points to `https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa.git`

To sync staging with loa: `git checkout staging && git pull upstream main`

## Research Capability Built

Created `/root/clawd/research/` with:
- `README.md` - Process documentation
- `log.md` - Research findings log
- `sources.json` - Tracking state
- `experiments/` - Detailed writeups
- `scout.sh` - Quick fetch script for arXiv/HN

### First Findings (high relevance for loa):
1. **Agent-RRM** - Multi-faceted reward model for agentic trajectories
2. **World of Workflows** - Enterprise benchmark, "dynamics blindness" insight
3. **Liquid Interfaces** - Ephemeral coordination paradigm

### Experiment Ideas:
- `experiment/reasoning-reward-model` - Adapt Agent-RRM for loa critique
- `experiment/world-modeling` - State prediction in Sprint agent

## Research Lab Fully Operational

Jani set up:
- Brave API key (wrangler secret + local .secrets/)
- Enhanced scout.sh (I rewrote it cleaner)
- Full PR workflow ready: legba-moltbot → loa

I rewrote scout.sh with:
- `hunt` - full research sweep
- `hn` - AI-filtered Hacker News
- Cleaner output formatting
- Auto-loads secrets

## Interesting HN Finds Today

- **AGENTS.md outperforms skills in agent evals** (Vercel blog) - 345 ⬆

- **Claude Code daily benchmarks for degradation tracking** - 687 ⬆

## Security

- Pre-commit hook blocks secret patterns (ghp_, sk-, AKIA)
- .gitignore blocks *.key, *credentials*, .env, etc.
- Hook tested and working

## Next Steps

1. Deep dive into Agent-RRM / RewardAgent papers
2. Experiment branch for loa Auditor improvements
3. Check that AGENTS.md Vercel post for ideas
